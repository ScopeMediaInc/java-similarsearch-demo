=============================

A simple java example showing how the Scope Java SDK is used

Installation
------------
* Clone or download this repo and open the project in your favourite IDE

If you want to use our Java SDK (recommended), need to do the following two steps:
* Clone or download Java SDK at https://github.com/ScopeMediaInc/scopecheck-sdk-java 
* install it to your local repository with 'gradle install'

Usage
------------
* Register a free account at: https://api.scopemedia.com/#/signup
* Create an application and you will receive your client ID and client Secret which you will use to authenticate your requests.
* Open the ScopeSDKClientTestApp.java file and replace 'CLIENT_ID', 'CLIENT_SECRET' with your value
* Prepare your testing image urls to test
* You can also check ScopeApiTestApp.java to see how to use the API directly without using the java SDK
